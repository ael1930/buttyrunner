	  </div>
	  <h2>What is it?</h2>
	  <p>ButtyRunner started as a joke between my work colleagues when organising the weekly trip to get bacon sandwiches in became more complicated. </p>
 	  <p>The idea is simple, you let your friends know (by email) that you're going to a shop to get a sandwich, a coffee (or anything really). You inlucde when and how much notice you need. Your friends then add their order to the list.</p> 
	  <h2>What's "alpha" all about?</h2>
	  <p>This service is new, very NEW! It's intended to test the basics and encourage feedback to allow the product to evolve. Use the <a href="/contact">contact page</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/buttyrunner" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/buttyrunner"  target="_blank">Facebook</a> to let me know what you think.</p>
	  <h2>Is it free?</h2>
	  <p>At the moment yes. But like all things, it costs a little to run. If you want to make a donation towards these runniung costs, then I'll be putting PayPal details on the site soon. In the future however, there will be advertising and some revenue generating micro-payments introduced.</p>
